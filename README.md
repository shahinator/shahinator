### Md Shahinur Rahman
### About Me

Hello Md Shahinur Rahman! It's great to hear about your studies and the projects you've worked on during your time at the Frankfurt University of Applied Sciences. Let's break down each of the projects you mentioned:

## 1. A Lightweight Survey Tool for Online Studies:
Developing a lightweight survey tool for online studies sounds like a valuable contribution, especially in the context of remote learning and research. Such a tool could help researchers and educators collect data and feedback efficiently from participants in online studies. It would be interesting to know more about the features and technologies used in the development of this tool.

## 2. YOLOv5 Dog-Cat Detection:
YOLO (You Only Look Once) is a popular real-time object detection algorithm, and YOLOv5 is an improved version. Your project focused on using YOLOv5 to detect and distinguish between dogs and cats, which is a classic application of object detection in the field of computer vision. Object detection has numerous practical applications, ranging from surveillance to autonomous vehicles.

## 3. Proper Mask-Wearing Detection System with Alarm:
In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, the development of a proper mask-wearing detection system is particularly relevant. This project likely involved computer vision techniques to detect whether individuals were wearing masks correctly or not. The system's alarm feature could serve as a helpful reminder for those not complying with mask-wearing guidelines.

These projects demonstrate a diverse range of skills and interests in computer science and engineering. They also have practical applications that could positively impact various domains, such as education, public health, and technology. Keep up the good work, and I wish you continued success in your studies and future endeavours! If you have any specific questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask.
